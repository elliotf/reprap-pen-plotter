* anchor holes on X ends
  * to anchor printer to a board
  * to make the board take the force of the belt tension rather than a cantilevered plastic part
* make Y max endstop trigger get hit instead of wheels
  * either make it adjustable or move it out farther
* make Y motor endcap thinner?
  * this would make the Y rail slide more over the X
  * this would give more room for other things
    * Y motor
    * wheeled side carriages
      * and X endstop cabling
