# TODO

* motor mounts (done)
  * and motor mount positioning (mostly)
* endstop mounting
  * x and z on the z axis mount
    * have X endstop hit something screwed into the extrusion?
  * y on the motor/idler mounts
* base plate
  * and ways to anchor motors/idler mounts to base (mostly)
* use correct diameter for brass threaded inserts
* compensate for spectra line diameter
  * 0.6 probably doesn't matter
    * and likely only the motor position is affected?
* angle contact point with z axis lifter to control acceleration?
  * rather than smacking the pen into the writing surface?
