# TODO

* motor mounts
  * and motor mount positioning
* endstop mounting
  * x and z on the z axis mount
    * have X endstop hit something screwed into the extrusion?
  * y on the motor/idler mounts
* spring to provide downforce on Z axis
* base plate
  * and ways to anchor motors/idler mounts to base
* use correct diameter for brass threaded inserts
* compensate for spectra line diameter
  * 0.6 probably doesn't matter
    * and likely only the motor position is affected?
